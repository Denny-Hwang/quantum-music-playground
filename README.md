## Introduction

The Quantum Music Playground is a tool for composing music, as well as an enjoyable way of gaining intuition about quantum circuits and states. It is implemented as a Max for Live device in the Ableton Live 11 digital audio workstation (DAW). The following screenshot shows an Ableton Live Session View that contains [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) clips that play the well known song entitled *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star*.
